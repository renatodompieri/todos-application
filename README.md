# Overview

This is a simple application created on top of Laravel 8 and Vue.js.

Basically it was made only to show the Modular / Repository architecture
that I like, combined with some good practices, such as feature tests, 
requests for CRUD actions, API versioning, translation files, etc.

Please take into consideration that you may find functions that were not 
fully implemented, especially because this was not created to be a perfect project,
instead was used to show a very nice architecture with good packages and apply
good practices and patterns.

# Installation

1. Create a database in your server i.e. 
   `CREATE DATABASE laravel_vue_crud_example`
   
2. Configure your environment file: `.env`

3. Generate an API key: `php artisan key:generate`
   
4. Install the composer dependencies: `composer install`

5. Install the node dependencies: `npm install`

7. Seed the database with users: `php artisan db:seed`
